## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- click a number of times for entered passenger
- See previous entries and save the number of passengers entered


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned


Learnt a lot in adding functions to html
```html
 <button id="increasing" onclick="increment()">INCREMENT</button>
        <button id="saving" onclick="saving()">SAVE</button>
```
Proud of this css
```css
body {
   background-image: url("istockphoto.jpg");
    background-size: cover;
}
```
Proud of this function
```js
function increment = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
